 Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. It encompasses a wide variety of technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). When most people use the term AI today, theyâ€™re often referring to machine learning-powered technologies that enable machines to perform tasks previously exclusive to humans, like generating written content, steering a car, or analyzing data
